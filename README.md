# About me

Micro.blog usually sets your blog's `description` to text like "Follow [username] on Micro.blog". This can be used by Hugo in your theme, although not all themes use this.

For themes or plug-ins that do use the `description`, this plug-in changes the text to be your "About me" text (under Account).
